    "# Network-Access Layer\n",
    "The Network Access layer of the TCP/IP model corresponds with the Data Link and Physical layers of the OSI reference model. It defines the protocols and hardware required to connect a host to a physical network and to deliver data across it. Packets from the Internet layer are sent down the Network Access layer for delivery within the physical network. The destination can be another host in the network, itself, or a router for further forwarding. So the Internet layer has a view of the entire Internetwork whereas the Network Access layer is limited to the physical layer boundary that is often defined by a layer 3 device such as a router.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Network Access layer consists of a large number of protocols. When the physical network is a LAN, Ethernet at its many variations are the most common protocols used. On the other hand when the physical network is a WAN, protocols such as the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Frame Relay are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`PPP` is, of course, primarily used to provide data link layer connectivity to physical serial links. One of the biggest problems with serial links compared to many other types of layer one connections is that they are relatively slow. Consider that while 10 Mbps regular Ethernet is considered sluggish by modern LAN standards, it is actually much faster than most serial lines used for WAN connectivity, which can be 10, 100 or even 1000 times slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve performance over serial links is to use compression on the data sent over the line. Depending on the data transferred, this can double the performance compared to uncompressed transmissions, and can in some cases do even better than that. For this reason, many hardware devices include the ability to compress the data stream at the physical layer. The best example of this is probably the set of compression protocols used on analog modems.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP)` is responsible for negotiating and managing the use of compression on a PPP link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Compression Control Protocol (CCP) is responsible for\n",
    "configuring, enabling, and disabling data compression algorithms on\n",
    "both ends of the point-to-point link.  It is also used to signal a\n",
    "failure of the compression/decompression mechanism in a reliable\n",
    "manner. A wide variety of compression\n",
    "methods may be negotiated, although typically only one method is used\n",
    "in each direction of the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different compression algorithm may be negotiated in each\n",
    "direction, for speed, cost, memory or other considerations, or only\n",
    "one direction may be compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Several of the **PPP Compression Algorithm** are defined in `Internet standards (RFCs)`. In addition, it is possible for two devices to negotiate the use of a proprietary compression method if they want to use one not defined by a public standard.\n",

    "## Huffman Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code. The variable-length codes assigned to input characters are `Prefix Codes`.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Prefix code** is a type of code system (typically a variable-length code) distinguished by its possession of the `“prefix property”`,i.e. the codes(bit sequences) are assigned in such a way that the code assigned to one character is not the prefix of code assigned to any other character. This is how Huffman Coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream. Consider the counter example, say there are four characters a, b, c and d, and their corresponding variable length codes be 00, 01, 0 and 1. This coding leads to ambiguity because code assigned to c is the prefix of codes assigned to a and b. If the compressed bit stream is 0001, the de-compressed output may be “cccd” or “ccb” or “acd” or “ab”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:**\n",
    "- Transmitting the characters with the higher frequencies with smaller bit sequences shall be an optimal compression strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Given:**\n",
    "- Input array of unique characters along with their frequency of occurrences \n",

    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Create a leaf node for each unique character and build a min heap of all leaf nodes (Min Heap is used as a priority queue. The value of frequency field is used to compare two nodes in min heap. Initially, the least frequent character is at root)\n",
    "2. Extract two nodes with the minimum frequency from the min heap.\n",
    ">This is a **Greedy Choice** since making the two symbols with least frequency have the maximum code length implicitly ensures reduced cost of transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a new internal node with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes frequencies. Make the first extracted node as its left child and the other extracted node as its right child. Add this node to the min heap.\n",

    "Arithmetic coding and Huffman coding produce equivalent results — achieving entropy — when every symbol has a probability of the form 1/2k. In other circumstances, arithmetic coding can offer better compression than Huffman coding because — intuitively — its \"code words\" can have effectively non-integer bit lengths, whereas code words in prefix codes such as Huffman codes can only have an integer number of bits. Therefore, a code word of length k only optimally matches a symbol of probability 1/2k and other probabilities are not represented optimally; whereas the code word length in arithmetic coding can be made to exactly match the true probability of the symbol. This difference is especially striking for small alphabet sizes.\n",

The largest entropy for a random variable will be possible if all events are performed equally likely.

Since, these information transactions are vulnerable to various attacks, a major role of the protocols at this layer is to ensure network security, which entails securing data against attacks while it is in transit on a network. Protocols like `SSH (Secure Shell)` and `SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security` are used as protection layersover protocols like the HTTP that employ encryption schemes like `RSA, ECC, 3DES, AES`.\n",

    "Encryption is a method of converting data into an undecipherable format so that only the authorized parties can access the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptographic keys, in conjunction with encryption algorithms, are what makes the encryption process possible. And, based on the way these keys are applied, there are two major types of encryption schemes that are widely used: `symmetric encryption` (where a **single secret key** is used to encrypt and decrypt data) and` asymmetric encryption` (where a **public key cryptosystem** is used and encryption and decryption is done using a pair of public and corresponding private key). Both of these methods use different mathematical algorithms (i.e., those encryption algorithms we mentioned moments ago) to scramble the data. \n",

    "### Symmetric Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetric encryption schemes use the same symmetric key (or password) to encrypt data and decrypt the encrypted data back to its original form:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](resources/18.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetric encryption usually combines several crypto algorithms into an symmetric encryption scheme, \n",
    "**e.g. AES-256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256**.\n",
    "The encryption scheme (cipher construction) may include: \n",
    "1. password to key derivation algorithm (with certain parameters)\n",
    "2. symmetric cipher algorithm (with certain parameters) \n",
    "3. cipher block mode algorithm + message authentication (MAC) algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the above shown diagram is simplified and does not fully represent the process.\n",
    ">**Secret Keys**\n",
    "The secret key used to cipher (encrypt) and decipher (decrypt) data is typically of size `128, 192 or 256 bits` and is sometimes referred as \"encryption key\" or \"shared key\", because both sending and receiving parties should know it.\n",
    "Most applications use a password-to-key-derivation scheme to extract a secret key from certain password, because users tend to remember passwords easier than binary data. Additionally, message authentication is often incorporated along with the encryption to provide integrity and authenticity (this encryption approach is known as \"authenticated encryption\").\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In many systems (e.g. public blockchains, PGP, OpenSSL and others) secret keys are encoded as `base58` or `base64` for shorter string representation.\n",

This ensures that the data remains protected against man-in-the-middle `(MiTM) attacks`. For web/email servers that connect to hundreds of thousands of clients ever minute, asymmetric encryption is nothing less than a boon as they only need to manage and protect a single key. Another key point is that public key cryptography allows creating an encrypted connection without having to meet offline to exchange keys first.\n",
    "2. The second crucial feature that asymmetric encryption offers is `authentication`. As we saw, the data encrypted by a public key can only be decrypted using the private key related to it. Therefore, it makes sure that the data is only seen and decrypted by the entity that’s supposed to receive it. In simpler terms, it verifies that you’re talking to the person or organization that you think you are.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large integer. The public key consists of two numbers where one number is multiplication of two large prime numbers. And private key is also derived from the same two prime numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but experts believe that 1024 bit keys could be broken in the near future. But till now it seems to be an infeasible task.\n",
